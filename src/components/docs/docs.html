            <h1>StringTone API Documentation</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>StringTone's API was designed with ease of operation in mind. Instead of requiring users to remember a dozen different endpoint URI's, all of the StringTone operations can be done from the same endpoint:</p>
            <div class="api-uri monochrome">
                <u>https://</u>
                <a href="https://stringtonejs.com/api">StringToneJS.com
                    <u>/</u>
                    api
                    <u>/</u>
                    -=TEXT=-</a>
            </div>
            <p>
                ...with additional functionality coming as a result of additional flags being passed, in any order, non-case-sensitive, to said endpoint.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Endpoint Domains</h2>
            <p>There are two primary domains through which the StringTone API (as well as this document) can be accesed:</p>
            <ul class="endpoint-domains">
                <li><u>https://</u><a href="https://stringtonejs.com/api/">StringToneJS.com/api/</a> </li>
                <li> and </li>
                <li><u>https://</u><a href="https://s2t.one/api/">S2T.one/api/</a>
                    <div class="footnote">*A full 56% savings of those precious, precious keystrokes!</div>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span>Basic API Operation</span><button class="example-button"></button></h2>
            <p><strong>To interact with StringTone's API</strong>, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET">GET</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">POST</a> request is made to one of th above endpoints. To specify which features you want to use, <a href="#flags">flags</a> are passed as part of the request url, each
                separated by a forward-slash (<code>/</code>). </p>
            <p><a href="#flags">flags</a> are non-case-sensitive, and can appear in any order, so long as you <strong>follow two hard-and-fast rules</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You must START the request with <code>api/</code>, and</li>
                <li>Any text that follows the final forward slash is assumed to be that which you want the color identifier for.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Let's take a look at the anatomy of the <strong>simplest possible request</strong> one can make:</p>

                <!--
            Assuming that the first path component is 'api',
            all subsequent path components are treated as options for the API, until the last path component,
            which is treated as the string to convert. It is presupposed that the string to convert is urlencoded;
            the options do not need to be.
            The following list contains all available options for requests made to the API. They can be used in any order,
            and any number of options can be used, but only the last of each type will be used.
        
            AVAILABLE OPTIONS:
            Category: Included Returns
            [D] fg: foreground color - the foreground color of the string to convert
            (this is the default option, and is used if no options are passed)
            bg: background color - this is the a11y-compliant background color for the foreground color of the string
            (Note that if both fg and bg are passed, both will be returned in the response!)
        
            verbose: verbose output - this returns the full object of the converted string, including the converted string,
        
            Category: Hex Format
            [D] deflate: deflate color - this deflates the foreground color to the shortest possible 3- or 4-digit hex/hexa code,
            depending on whether the original color was 6- or 8-digit and assuming each color channel
            is repeated (ex: #aaccff -> #acf; #ff0000ff -> #f00f).
            inflate: inflate color - this inflates the foreground color to the full 6- or 8-digit hex/hexa code,
            depending on whether the original color was 3- or 4-digit and if it isn't already
            (ex: #acf -> #aaccff; #f00f -> #ff0000ff).
            round: round color - this rounds and deflates the foreground color to the nearest web-safe color
            (Note that only the last option of this type will be used!)
        
            Category: Color Format
            [D] hex: hex color - returns the requested color(s) as hex colors
            (this is the default option, and is used if no options are passed)
            hexa: hexa color - returns the requested color(s) as hexa colors
            rgb: rgb color - returns the requested color(s) as rgb colors
            rgba: rgba color - returns the requested color(s) as rgba colors
            hsl: hsl color - returns the requested color(s) as hsl colors
            hsla: hsla color - returns the requested color(s) as hsla colors
            cmyk: cmyk color - returns the requested color(s) as cmyk colors
            cmyka: cmyka color - returns the requested color(s) as cmyka colors
            (Note that only the last option of this type will be used!)
        
            Category: Return Format
            [D] string: string - returns the requested color(s) as a string (or an object formatted as a string if necessary)
            (this is the default option, and is used if no options are passed)
            object: object - returns the requested color(s) as an object

            <h2><span>Advanced Operations: Flags</span><button class="example-button"></button></h2>
            <p><strong>Flags are also supported</strong> by StringTone's API. These are request modifiers that can be included as
                segments of the request URL that can change the behavior of the request and/or the output of the return.</p>
            <h3>Types of Flag</h3>
            <p>Flags fall into two categories: <strong>Cumulative Flags</strong> and <strong>Mutually-Exclusive Flags</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Cumulative Flags</strong> are those that can be used in conjunction with one another, and will all be applied to the request.</p>
            <p><strong>Mutually-Exclusive Flags</strong> are those that cannot be used in conjunction with one another, and will override any other 
            flags of the same type that are passed.</p>
            <h3>Using Flags</h3>
            <p>You may include as many include as many flags as you like in a request. They are not case-sensitive, can appear in any order within 
                the request URL, and should be separated by "<code>/</code>". The only restrictions are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>They must appear <em>after</em> the "<code>api/</code>" portion of the request URI.</li>
                <li>They must appear <em>before</em> the final "<code>/</code>" within the URI (or they will be interpreted as part of the text to convert).</li>
                <li>In the case of Mutually-Exclusive Flags, <em>only the final of within that category will be respected.</em></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Let's look at the available flags, and then we'll show some examples.</p>
            <h3>Available Flags</h3>

                                nearest websafe color, or in cases where your own application needs a passthrough response or a noop. <br><br>
                                <strong>Important:</strong> as with any text passed within a URI, the hashtag/octothorpe (<code>#</code>) must be URI-encoded as
                                <code>%23</code> or it will be interpreted as the beginning of a fragment identifier and will be ignored.<br><br>

                                <code>https://stringtonejs.com/api/C0FFEE</code> will return <code>#8020B9</code>. <br>

                                In both cases, the hex color value is being interpreted as the string you are attempting to convert. <br><br>
